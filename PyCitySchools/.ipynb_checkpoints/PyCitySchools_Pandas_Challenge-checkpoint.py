# ## District Summary
# 
# * Calculate the total number of schools
# 
# * Calculate the total number of students
# 
# * Calculate the total budget
# 
# * Calculate the average math score 
# 
# * Calculate the average reading score
# 
# * Calculate the percentage of students with a passing math score (70 or greater)
# 
# * Calculate the percentage of students with a passing reading score (70 or greater)
# 
# * Calculate the percentage of students who passed math **and** reading (% Overall Passing)
# 
# * Create a dataframe to hold the above results
# 
# * Optional: give the displayed data cleaner formatting

# ## School Summary

# * Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
#   * School Name
#   * School Type
#   * Total Students
#   * Total School Budget
#   * Per Student Budget
#   * Average Math Score
#   * Average Reading Score
#   * % Passing Math
#   * % Passing Reading
#   * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)
#   
# * Create a dataframe to hold the above results

# In[9]:





# ## Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

# * Sort and display the top five performing schools by % overall passing.

# In[10]:





# ## Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

# * Sort and display the five worst-performing schools by % overall passing.

# In[11]:





# ## Math Scores by Grade

# * Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
# 
#   * Create a pandas series for each grade. Hint: use a conditional statement.
#   
#   * Group each series by school
#   
#   * Combine the series into a dataframe
#   
#   * Optional: give the displayed data cleaner formatting

# In[12]:





# ## Reading Score by Grade 

# * Perform the same operations as above for reading scores

# In[13]:





# ## Scores by School Spending

# * Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:
#   * Average Math Score
#   * Average Reading Score
#   * % Passing Math
#   * % Passing Reading
#   * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

# In[18]:





# ## Scores by School Size

# * Perform the same operations as above, based on school size.
